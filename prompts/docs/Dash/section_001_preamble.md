Quickstart

[Installation](https://dash.plotly.com/installation "How to install and upgrade Dash") [A Minimal Dash App](https://dash.plotly.com/minimal-app "This page will show you a common template for a minimal Dash app.") [Dash in 20 Minutes Tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial "Learn to create a Dash app in 20 minutes with this tutorial. Follow step-by-step instructions and start building interactive web apps today!\"")

Dash Fundamentals

[Part 1. Layout](https://dash.plotly.com/layout "The Dash `layout` describes what your app will look like and is composed of a set of declarative Dash components.") [Part 2. Basic Callbacks](https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks "Dash apps are made interactive through Dash Callbacks: chainable functions that are automatically called whenever a UI element is changed.") [Part 3. Interactive Graphing and Crossfiltering](https://dash.plotly.com/interactive-graphing "Graphs can be inputs as well as outputs: bind interactivity to the Dash `Graph` component whenever you hover, click, or select points on your chart.") [Part 4. Sharing Data Between Callbacks](https://dash.plotly.com/sharing-data-between-callbacks "Global variables will break your Dash apps. However, there are other ways to share data between callbacks. This chapter is useful for callbacks that run expensive data processing tasks or process large data.") [Part 5. Publishing Your App](https://dash.plotly.com/deployment "Share your data app with colleagues or analysts by publishing it to Plotly Cloud or Dash Enterprise. Learn about app access for your chosen deployment platform.")

Dash Callbacks

[Advanced Callbacks](https://dash.plotly.com/advanced-callbacks "Now that you've gotten through the basics, explore some other things you can do with callbacks - from performance improvements to callback contexts.") [Clientside Callbacks](https://dash.plotly.com/clientside-callbacks "You might want to execute a callback in the frontend as opposed to the backend if you want to avoid the extra time that it takes to make a roundtrip to the server. Clientside callbacks allow you to write your callbacks in JavaScript that runs in the browser.") [Pattern-Matching Callbacks](https://dash.plotly.com/pattern-matching-callbacks "The pattern-matching callback selectors `MATCH`, `ALL`, & `ALLSMALLER` allow you to write callbacks that respond to or update an arbitrary or dynamic number of components.") [Partial Property Updates](https://dash.plotly.com/partial-properties "Improve app performance by using partial updates to Dash component properties.") [Background Callbacks](https://dash.plotly.com/background-callbacks "Use background callbacks to implement long-running callbacks and avoid server timeouts.") [Flexible Callback Signatures](https://dash.plotly.com/flexible-callback-signatures "Flexible Callback Signatures in Dash 2.0 let you use keyword arguments, group arguments using dicts or tuples, and mix `Input` and `State` dependencies objects.") [Duplicate Callback Outputs](https://dash.plotly.com/duplicate-callback-outputs "Understanding the duplicate callback output error") [Determining Which Callback Input Changed](https://dash.plotly.com/determining-which-callback-input-changed "Understanding callback context and determining which input triggered a callback") [Callback Error Handlers](https://dash.plotly.com/callback-error-handlers "Learn how to create custom error handlers that will run when exceptions occur in a callback.") [Callback Gotchas](https://dash.plotly.com/callback-gotchas "Dash callbacks have some idiosyncrasies that should be taken into consideration when building a Dash app. If you're running into unexpected callback behavior, and the rest of the documentation hasn't shed any light on the situation, try taking a look at this page.")
