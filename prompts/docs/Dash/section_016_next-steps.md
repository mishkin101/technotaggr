## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have learned to build and style your first Dash app.
This is the first step of an exciting Dash learning journey that will give you the skills and tools to build sophisticated Python analytics apps.
There's lots more you can learn from the [Dash Fundamentals](https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks) and the rest of this documentation.

When you're ready, why not get feedback directly from your app's intended audience?
The beauty of your Dash app is that you can share it as a URL with just a few clicks using [Plotly Cloud](https://plotly.com/cloud/)!
Plotly handles the whole infrastructure so all you need to do is to upload your app files and copy the URL.
